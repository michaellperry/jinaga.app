## Installing

Create a new folder for your app and follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

You will set up a back end in Node using MongoDB for storage and Google OAuth2 for authentication. So you will need Node and MongoDB installed, and you will need to sign up for a [Google Developers account](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/devconsole-project).

Set up your folder. Initialize NPM and answer all of its questions. Change "index.js" to "server.js". This will create a package.json file.

```
npm init
```

And then initialize Bower. This is how you will pull down the client side packages.

```
npm install --save bower
bower init
```

Answer all of the questions. This will create a bower.json file.

If that command didn't work, then you might need to install Bower globally.

```
npm install -g bower
```

Furthermore, if you are using Windows, you might need to run this in a DOS shell rather than Bash. When you have Bower installed and initialized, you can install
the packages.

### Install packages

Install the Jinaga App packages.

```
npm install --save jinaga.app
bower install --save jinaga.app
```

Install your favorite CSS framework.

```
bower install --save foundation-sites
```

### Server.js

Create a file called `server.js`. This name should match the `main` setting in your `package.json`. Enter this code:

```JavaScript
var app = require('jinaga.app');

app.start(__dirname);
```

### Config.js

The app loads its configuration from a file called `config/config.js`. The config file will contain application secrets. Never ever check it in to your repository. Add the rule to `.gitignore`:

```
config/config.js
```

Now, create the `config` directory and `config.js`. Enter this code:

```JavaScript
module.exports = {
    baseUrl: 'http://localhost:8080',
    google: {
        clientId: 'xxx',
        clientSecret: 'yyy'
    },
    mongoDB: 'mongodb://localhost:27017/dev',
	secure: false
};
```

The `secure` setting controls whether the Jinaga connection uses TLS, so you'll want this to be false for development.

Log on to the [Google Developer](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials) site in order to get your `clientId` and `clientSecret`. If you don't want to secure your app yet, then you can leave it as xxx and yyy for now.

To set up your application, add an authorized JavaScript origin from http://localhost:8080, and an authorized redirect URI to http://localhost:8080/loginGoogle/callback.

Now start the app by running:

```
DEBUG=jinaga.* node server
```

Test it by going to http://localhost:8080/status.

### Content folders

Create a couple of folders: `public` and `private`. These will contain your site's content. The public folder will not require authentication, but the private folder will. Create an `index.html` file in the public folder, which will be the root of your site.

Use your favorite CSS framework to create a shell page at `public/index.html`:

```html
<html>
    <head>
        <title>MyApp</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="/bower_components/foundation-sites/dist/foundation.min.css">
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>My App</h1>
        <p data-bind="text: message"></p>

        <script src="/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script>
        <script src="/bower_components/foundation-sites/dist/foundation.min.js"></script>
        <script src="/bower_components/knockout/dist/knockout.js"></script>
        <script src="/bower_components/jinaga/jinaga.js"></script>
        <script src="/bower_components/jinaga.app/jinaga.knockout.js"></script>
        <script src="/config.js"></script>
        <script src="/public/myapp.js"></script>

        <script>
            $(document).foundation();
            ko.applyBindings(new MainViewModel());
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
```

Notice the `/config.js`. That's a server-generated file that gives the client-side components their configuration.

### View model

Finally, create a file for your application in the public folder called `myapp.js`. This is the last file that your page loads. For now, just create a view model:

```JavaScript
function MainViewModel() {
    this.message = ko.observable('It works!');
}
```

Start the app again (`DEBUG=jinaga.* node server`), and test it by going to http://localhost:8080.
